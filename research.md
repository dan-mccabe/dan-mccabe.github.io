# My Research

My PhD research is focused on battery-electric buses (BEBs). Transit agencies across the U.S. (as well as the rest of the world) have ambitious plans to reduce their emissions and BEBs will be an important technology to support that goal. However, they also present challenges to bus operators due to limited driving ranges and slow recharging times in comparison with buses that use liquid fuels. My work on BEBs consists of two main thrusts:

1) Optimization models for both long-range planning and daily operations of transit systems using BEBs. This includes planning for recharging infrastructure and scheduling charging during the day. These problems are simple to understand and state, but solving them turns out to be very computationally challenging.
2) Software tools to facilitate running these models and visualizing their results. This includes one public-facing tool so far, the [Zero-Emission Bus Range & Recharging Assessment (ZEBRA)](https://bit.ly/zebra-app). This public web app is compatible with most American transit agencies' public GTFS data and processes data on vehicle blocks (daily trip assignments for each bus) to determine range requirements and potential recharging needs.
