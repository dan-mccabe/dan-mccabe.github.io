# Pedaling Relief Project
I was lucky to get connected to Cascade Bicycle Club's [Pedaling Relief Project](https://cascade.org/outreach-advocacy/pedaling-relief-project) through my Transportation Logistics class at UW in 2022. As a course project, I developed code to generate delivery routes from the University District Food Bank to recipients across North Seattle. My work was featured in [this article](https://www.ce.washington.edu/news/article/2022-09-06/power-pedaling) in the CEE magazine and I continue to volunteer with PRP regularly. Major thanks to Maxwell Burton at Cascade for putting together such an amazing program, and to course instructors Anne Goodchild and Giacomo Dalla Chiara for making the connection to Maxwell and PRP!
