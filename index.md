# Dan McCabe, Transportation Engineer

I'm a 5th-year PhD student in Civil & Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, advised by [Dr. Jeff Ban](https://www.ce.washington.edu/facultyfinder/xuegang-%28jeff%29-ban). I love using optimization and data science to explore how to make transit more sustainable and efficient. My [PhD research](/research) focuses on mixed-integer programming models and algorithms to help convert transit fleets to battery-electric buses while limiting costs and maintaining good operations. I've also built a tool called [ZEBRA](https://bit.ly/zebra-app) to help transit agencies assess the challenges of electrifying their bus fleets, based mostly on GTFS data with minimal other inputs needed.

Outside of buses and other electric vehicles, I'm passionate about bikes in all forms! I've been the president of [Husky Cycling](https://www.huskycyclinguw.com), UW's cycling club, since 2019. I love riding around the city and beyond as well as participating in road, mountain bike, and cyclocross races. I've had a few fun opportunities to mix my love of bikes with my schoolwork, including [designing bicycle delivery routes for food banks](/prp) and [finding the shortest route to ride every trail](/prp) at my favorite local mountain bike spot.

My CV is available as a webpage [here](/cv) or a PDF [here](/McCabeResume2023.pdf).
