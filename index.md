# Dan McCabe, Ph.D.

I'm a transportation researcher and optimization expert passionate about sustainability. I'm currently a postdoc at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), where my research focuses on optimization, simulation, and data science for freight transportation and public transit systems.

I received my PhD in Civil Engineering from the University of Washington in 2024 under the guidance of my advisor, [Dr. Jeff Ban](https://www.ce.washington.edu/facultyfinder/xuegang-%28jeff%29-ban). I've loved using optimization and data science to explore how to make transit systems even more sustainable and efficient. My [PhD research](/research) focused on mixed-integer programming models and algorithms to help convert transit fleets to battery-electric buses while limiting costs and maintaining good operations. I also built a tool called [ZEBRA](https://bit.ly/zebra-app) to help transit agencies assess the challenges of electrifying their bus fleets, based mostly on GTFS data with minimal other inputs needed.

Outside of buses and other electric vehicles, I'm passionate about bikes in all forms! I was the president of [Husky Cycling](https://www.huskycyclinguw.com), UW's cycling club, from 2021 through 2024. I love riding around the city and beyond as well as participating in road, mountain bike, and cyclocross races. I've had a few fun opportunities to mix my love of bikes with my professional skills, including [designing bicycle delivery routes for food banks](/prp) and [finding the shortest route to ride every trail](/wrpp) at my favorite local mountain bike spot.

My academic CV is available as a webpage [here](/cv).
